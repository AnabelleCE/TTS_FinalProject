Introduction:
Tech Talent and Strategy, formerly Tech Talent South, is a woman-owned tech recruitment, training, and staffing agency. As a recepient oftheir Gradruate Accelerator Program scholarship, I completed their 12 week Data Science Bootcamp. At the end of the bootcamp, participants had to complete a final project for their portfolio, in which an accurate supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning models should be the final result.

Problem Statement:
For this project the purpose was to predict stock prices for Amazon based on historical stock data found through Yahoo Finance. For the supervised ML model, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) was used. For the unsupervised ML model, K-Means clustering was used to the determine which of a group of companies selected were the most similar to Amazon in terms of stock performance.

Additionally, to gain more hands on experience using different prograaming languages, I opted to complete two versions of the project using both Python and R.
